# BookStore-App
A simple asynchronous communication system for an online bookstore using C#,  Asp.Net, APIs, and RabbitMQ.

A hypothetical online bookstore is growing and needs to improve the communication system between its 
various services. Users are allowed to browse through books, add them to the cart, and finally, make a 
purchase. Once a purchase is made, the system should be able to update the stock.
